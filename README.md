# Prolog

The Prolog language is used for theorem proving, expert systems, term rewriting, type systems, and automated planning, as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing (from wikipedia).

There are 2 applications in prolog I worked on in this repository.

  1. Frame Based System
  2. Fuzzy Inference System
